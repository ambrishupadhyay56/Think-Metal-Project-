# Think-Metal-Project-
In this project i have used NodeMCU(ESP8266) in combination with Arduino Nano 
Both peripherals Relay and DC Fan is being controlled over internet via Adafruit.io Server which can be accessed by any device.
All the data from server is being received by NodeMCU which is connected to server via wifi and transmitted to Arduino via Serial Communication
according to the received Command Arduino board Switches on/off the relay or controls the speed of fan. 
in this way we can add up to 20 peripherals to Arduino and 7 peripherals to NodeMCU.
